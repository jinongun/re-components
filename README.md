Reusable components for React.

## Motivation

I've made a lot of COMPONENTs for React.js in my project. Almost all of them are developed for only a specific project and used. They depend on project specifics. When I developed a COMPONENT in a project, and I tried to use that again, I had to retouch that. I think it is not good.
